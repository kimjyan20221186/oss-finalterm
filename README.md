## project title and motivation
This is explanation of my finalterm project of OpenSW. The project was increasing the accuracy of image classification using only sklearn. I tried to use algorithms to improve accuracy with optuna, the hyperparameter tuning framework.
## Code development
I will explain the final submitted file first. I did not touch a given preprocessing process and tried to improve performance by changing only algorithms and hyperparameters. So I imported KNeighborsClassifier and tuned the hyperparameters to improve performance.
